<!-- Visualization recommender systems attempt to automate design decisions spanning
choices of selected data, transformations, and visual encodings. However, across
invocations such recommenders may lack the context of prior results, producing
unstable outputs that override earlier design choices. To better balance
automated suggestions with user intent, we contribute Dziban, a visualization
API that supports both ambiguous specification and a novel anchoring mechanism
for conveying desired context. Dziban uses the Draco knowledge base to
automatically complete partial specifications and suggest appropriate
visualizations. In addition, it extends Draco with chart similarity logic,
enabling recommendations that also remain perceptually similar to a provided
"anchor" chart. Existing APIs for exploratory visualization, such as ggplot2 and
Vega-Lite, require fully specified chart definitions. In contrast, Dziban
provides a more concise and flexible authoring experience through automated
design, while preserving predictability and control through anchored
recommendations. -->
