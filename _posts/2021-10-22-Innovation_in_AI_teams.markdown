Innovation and AI are two words that often go hand in hand. However, depending on the type of setting an AI team is embedded in - the semantics on ‘Innovation’ can vary. 

If you are part of the research lab, this often means AI team works on fundamental problems and create fundamental & new techniques to power cutting-edge solutions. They publish a lot, advance the entire area in a fundamental way - this is their true north star. It goes without saying this means lot of publications, very close collaboration with academia etc. 

When it comes to AI teams working in the product settings, the innovation here is of very different type. And in this post and next I will try n focus on this facet. There are mainly 4 type of innovations that happen in such teams: 

1. Finding newer uses cases and touch points in your product(s) where AI can deliver a completely new experience to the user : This innovation often creates USP/key differentiator for the product compared to the competition in the respective segment. And if the feature is killer, it changes the user’s behavior which in turn changes user expectation. And then the competition has no other option but to play the catch-up game. This creates a very strong moat. For example, YouTube uses AI to generate subtitles in multiple languages on the fly. They have fundamentally changed user expectations and other platforms have to have a similar feature.

This kind of innovation is often not as easy as it may sound. I have written about this in an earlier post (ref : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6830708981107867648-JQz_/). This requires first principle thinking. Product managers who can envision features in a completely new way using AI, very close collaboration between AI & product teams to understand what is possible what is not, a very good execution to deliver A-class experience (despite AI model will make mistakes).

2. Building the dataset for the problem at hand : For AI teams embedded in product settings, building a comprehensive dataset for the problem at hand is often 80% of the battle. Building such a dataset is never writing a bunch of queries on a massive data store at your disposal. AI Teams often have to come up with very smart strategies, hacks to augment data to arrive at a comprehensive dataset. Also, this is not a one-time activity but often highly iterative. What more type of data is needed - comes from the kind of mistakes your models are making. 

I will soon be writing a dedicated post on some of the best examples I have seen/heard on innovative ideas to collect data. 

3. Publishing paper/patent (doesn’t happen that often) : AI teams embedded in product teams do write patents and papers - but this is seldom their true north star. 

So what about coming up with newer techniques? Rarely AI teams embedded in product teams do this. Why? Because in most cases, known techniques with a comprehensive dataset with rigorous evaluation itself can take your AI solution very very far on business metrics. From there on it is mostly a game of diminishing returns. Read about “later part of S curve” in my earlier post on “ROI in AI” (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6842736295173775360-etDf/). This is not true only if AI is the backbone of your product and your core value proposition.
