A lot of people often ask me some of the key insights I gained up in my journey over last decade in building AI systems and teams.

Happy to share that over the next 1 year, I will try to put 1-2 posts every week sharing these insights. These will cover topics like ROI, how to do AI right, building and nurturing AI teams, why most AI projects fail, the right way to approach AI, when to apply AI, how AI is done in product teams, etc Follow [#Learnings_From_AI_Trenches on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23learnings_from_ai_trenches&origin=CLUSTER_EXPANSION&sid=%2CBE). Stay tuned

If there is any topic you will like me to write about, pls comment in the post below. I will try and cover them as well. Let us make this super interactive.
