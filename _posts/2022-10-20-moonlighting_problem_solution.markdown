Moonlighting in tech has emerged as major stress for companies. Below is my personal take on it: 

The core reason IMO is: companies/consultants project every job as very high-end work (once-in-a-lifetime opportunity) but often the reality is very different. Being a knowledge industry, tech leaders talk about hunting as lion (hunt, rest, repeat) but in reality do nothing to facilitate it and make you work like a cow (graze all day). All this along with 'fairness' in compensation + hire-fire policy means there is nothing left nothing on employee loyalty. Now that employees are giving back to employers a dose of their own medicine (no show on day of joining, quick churn) - there is hue n cry! IMO the blame lies equally on both sides. 

Possible Solution? Both employees and employers must understand, professional relationship is a 2 way street. Both will have to do their part to solve it: 

1. Organizations must clearly specify minimum working hours they expect. Be explit, say Mon-Fri (10am-7pm) or watever works for them. Be reasonable - dont say 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week! 

2. In their free time, employees should be free to pursue their interests - some like to chill n watch Netflix, others like to work on side gigs. That should be entirely employee's choice - no organizations should not dictate this. 

3. Organizations should make moonlighting policy super transparent. Create a system where employees must inform of all side gigs to the employer. In return, employers must not object to side gigs unless there is a clear conflict of interest. 

4. Organizations should evaluate employees purely on their performance in their organization. If the performance is great, reward them accordingly. If not, put them on PIP or let them go. Unless a side gig is clearly impacting an employee's performance - it should not concern the employer. 

5. Employees must understand companies will be more transparent only if employees don't cheat. So:
- Only 1 full-time employment. Can't take 2 overlapping jobs. To be more precise - time commitment of one job must not conflict with time commitment of any other gig. 
- Employee can have side gigs but only in your free time (time not commited to organization). 
- Employee must inform of all side gigs to employer. 
- Employers must not object to side gigs unless there is a clear conflict of interest. 
- Employees's side gig cannot be with competitor companies for up to 1 yrs (maybe even 2 years) after leaving any employer. Organizations must have a strong right to protect IP, business strategy, internal details etc. Any clear conflict of interest must be strictly prohibited.

6) Despite all this, if an employee moonlighting, Organizations should have the legal right to take a very strict action and penalize them heavily. 

A bunch of companies such as Swiggy have created such policies. 100% transparency on both sides is the only way forward to create a true knowledge economy. IMO the way to attract really smart people in a knowledge economy is flexibility, challenging work and transparency.

What is your take? pls do put in comments below.
