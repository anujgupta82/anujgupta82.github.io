Moonlighting in tech has emerged as major stress for companies. Below is my personal take on it: 

The core reason IMO is: companies/consultants project every job as very high-end work (once-in-a-lifetime opportunity) but often the reality is very different. Being a knowledge industry, tech leaders talk about hunting as lion (hunt, rest, repeat) but in reality do nothing to facilitate it and make you work like a cow (graze all day). All this along with 'fairness' in compensation + hire-fire policy means there is nothing left nothing on employee loyalty. Now that employees are giving back to employers a dose of their own medicine (no show on day of joining, quick churn) - there is hue n cry! IMO the blame lies equally on both sides. 

Possible Solution? Both employees and employers must understand, professional relationship is a 2 way street. Both will have to do their part to solve it: 

1. Organizations must clearly specify minimum working hours they expect. Be explit, say Mon-Fri (10am-7pm) or watever works for them. Be reasonable - dont say 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week! 

2) In their free time, people are free to do whatever they like - some like to chill n watch Netflix, others like to work on side gigs. That's their choice - a company should not dictate this. 

3) Companies should make it super transparent and create a setting where employees must inform of all side gigs to the employer. In return, Employers must not object to side gigs unless there is a clear conflict of interest. 

4) Company should evaluate employees purely on their performance. if the performance is great, great. If not, let them go. Unless a side gig is clearly impacting an employee's performance - it should not concern the employer. 

5) Employees must understand companies will be more transparent only if employees don't cheat. So
- Only 1 full-time employment. Can't take 2 overlapping jobs
- You can have side gigs but only in your free time. 
- Employee must inform of all side gigs to employers. 
- Employers must not object to side gigs unless there is a clear conflict of interest. 
- Employees's side gig cannot be with competitor companies for up to 1 yrs (maybe even 2) after leaving any employer. Companies should be able to protect internal details. Any clear conflict of interest must be strictly prohibited.

6) Despite all this, if an employee moonlighting, companies should have the legal right to take very strict action and penalize heavily. 

A lot of companies such as Swiggy have created such policies. 100% transparency on both sides is the only way forward to create a true knowledge economy. IMO the way to attract really smart people in a knowledge economy is flexibility, challenging work and transparency.

What is your take? pls do put in comments below.
Would love to know how is this playing out in other major geographies around the globe

A lot of companies and teams are betting big on DeepTech like AI to drive the next phase of growth. While AI can certainly be the “energy” to help you move to the next orbit, most teams falter big time. While there are many reasons for this, one key reason is the ill-founded expectations by senior people (VPs, CXOs, business leaders etc) in the company. Today’s post will explore this facet of AI - often the least spoken one. 

Most leaders/companies start AI in their teams/product lines much later. Traditional corporate wisdom has always advocated “quick” wins because that is how one establishes themselves and gets the key stakeholders super excited. So they advocate the same in AI!

This is also driven by: 
1. Articles on AI in popular media with lofty claims (remember the humanoid dancing in Tesla AI day or Sophia - not many people understand these are mere marketing and perception gimmicks)
2. The thought that AI at the end of the day is a code - so it cannot be very different from software engineering. The issues are mere initial hiccups which is always the case with any new tech, so is the case with AI

So most leaders expect the ROI curve in AI to be a vertical takeoff. This expectation is further fueled by the fact that AI doesn't come cheap - data, data engg & AI teams, talent cost, hardware cost, data collection & labeling cost and time etc, MLOps etc Read my previous write up titled [the economics of AI](https://lnkd.in/eCqRgq7v)

This is where most Orgs/Teams make THE mistake. The true ROI curve in AI is very very different from their expectations. As shown in the figure below, it follows a S shape curve.

1. Initial lower part of S: One needs to invest a lot of time and energy with very little ROI - finding [the right use case](https://lnkd.in/e6-ikYb9), right quality and quantity of data and labels (more on this in another post), right modeling approach, right metrics etc. This can take anywhere between 1-3 years. 

2. Middle part of S: This is where one gets the highest ROI per unit effort. This is because most of the hard work has been done in the first 1-3 years. All key stakeholders have a better understanding of the AI journey. This phase is all  about building the 2nd/3rd version of AI systems 

3. Later upper part of S: This is where the ROI again starts to stagnate. This phase is where your team is building the 6th/7th version of the system and trying to push systems performance to the upper 90s. This often requires completely new approaches, new algorithms. Its not just adding a couple of lines of code!  

Another thing most folks don't necessarily understand is that each of the 3 different phases of the curve requires a very different strategy - type of goals, kind of skillsets, focus areas, etc
