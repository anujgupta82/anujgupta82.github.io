Yesterday I was reading an [article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/) on recent layoffs at Alexa voice assistant unit in Amazon. This got me thinking. I believe the whole episode contains some critical lessons for many AI teams: 

1) You can have the most cutting-edge technology which even your competition tries to copy, yet if it doesn't move business needles it is a liability.

2) Business & Product took a leap of faith that users will order goods purely using voice without even looking at items even once. This and other monetization efforts didn't happen and everything fell apart.

3) Mistakes made by the product team are super expensive. PMs must find ways to list down and validate assumptions, especially leap of faith, as quickly as possible. In the case of Alexa, I wonder if there were ways to test these without having to invest so much time & effort.  

4) Alexa single-handedly contributed to so many developments in speech tech, it is an absolute marvel. Yet reduced only to alarms, how is the weather outside and play <abc> song. Primarily due to points (2) and (3). 

5) Business needs to understand that building cutting-edge tech takes time - no matter how much you may push, it cant be done in days, weeks or sometimes even months.
