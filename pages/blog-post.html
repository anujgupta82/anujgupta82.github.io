                        <h1>Lessons from Recent Layoffs in AI</h1>
                        <p>Yesterday I was reading an article on recent layoffs at Alexa voice assistant unit in Amazon.
                            This got me thinking. I believe the whole episode contains some critical lessons for many AI
                            teams:</p>

                        <div class="archive__item-excerpt">
                            <h2>Key Lessons:</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You can have the most cutting-edge technology which even your competition tries to
                                    copy, yet if it doesn’t move business needles it is a liability.</li>
                                <li>Business & Product took a leap of faith that users will order goods purely using
                                    voice without even looking at items even once. This and other monetization efforts
                                    didn’t happen and everything fell apart.</li>
                                <li>Mistakes made by the product team are super expensive. PMs must find ways to list
                                    down and validate assumptions, especially leap of faith, as quickly as possible. In
                                    the case of Alexa, I wonder if there were ways to test these without having to
                                    invest so much time & effort.</li>
                                <li>Alexa single-handedly contributed to so many developments in speech tech, it is an
                                    absolute marvel. Yet reduced only to alarms, how is the weather outside and play
                                    song. Primarily due to points (2) and (3).</li>
                                <li>Business needs to understand that building cutting-edge tech takes time - no matter
                                    how much you may push, it can't be done in days, weeks or sometimes even months.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>Moonlighting in tech has emerged as major stress for companies. Below is my personal take on
                            it:
                            <br>
                            The core reason IMO is: companies/consultants project every job as very high-end work
                            (once-in-a-lifetime opportunity) but often the reality is very different. Being a knowledge
                            industry, tech leaders talk about hunting as lion (hunt, rest, repeat) but in reality do
                            nothing to facilitate it and make you work like a cow (graze all day). All this along with
                            ‘fairness’ in compensation + hire-fire policy means there is nothing left nothing on
                            employee loyalty. Now that employees are giving back to employers a dose of their own
                            medicine (no show on day of joining, quick churn) - there is hue n cry! IMO the blame lies
                            equally on both sides.
                            <br><br>
                            Possible Solution? Both employees and employers must understand, professional relationship
                            is a 2 way street. Both will have to do their part to solve it:


                        </p>

                        <div class="archive__item-excerpt">

                            <ul>
                                <li>Organizations must clearly specify minimum working hours they expect. Be explit, say
                                    Mon-Fri (10am-7pm) or watever works for them. Be reasonable - dont say 24 hrs a day,
                                    7 days a week!</li>
                                <li>In their free time, employees should be free to pursue their interests - some like
                                    to chill n watch Netflix, others like to work on side gigs. That should be entirely
                                    employee’s choice - no organizations should not dictate this</li>
                                <li>Organizations should make moonlighting policy super transparent. Create a system
                                    where employees must inform of all side gigs to the employer. In return, employers
                                    must not object to side gigs unless there is a clear conflict of interest.</li>
                                <li>Organizations should evaluate employees purely on their performance in their
                                    organization. If the performance is great, reward them accordingly. If not, put them
                                    on PIP or let them go. Unless a side gig is clearly impacting an employee’s
                                    performance - it should not concern the employer.</li>
                                <li>Employees must understand companies will be more transparent only if employees don’t

                                            precise - time commitment of one job must not conflict with time commitment
                                            of any other gig.</li>

                                        <li>Employers must not object to side gigs unless there is a clear conflict of

                                            (maybe even 2 years) after leaving any employer. Organizations must have a
                                            strong right to protect IP, business strategy, internal details etc. Any
                                            clear conflict of interest must be strictly prohibited.</li>

                        <p>Innovation and AI are two words that often go hand in hand. However, depending on the type of
                            setting an AI team is embedded in - the semantics on ‘Innovation’ can vary.
                            <br>

                            If you are part of the research lab, this often means AI team works on fundamental problems
                            and create fundamental & new techniques to power cutting-edge solutions. They publish a lot,
                            advance the entire area in a fundamental way - this is their true north star. It goes
                            without saying this means lot of publications, paper presentation, talks & tutorials at
                            research conferences, very close collaboration with academia etc.
                            <br>
                            When it comes to AI teams working in the product settings, the innovation here is of very
                            different type. And in this post and next I will try n focus on this facet. There are mainly
                            4 type of innovations that happen in such teams:
                        </p>

                        <div class="archive__item-excerpt">

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Finding newer uses cases and touch points in your product(s) where AI can
                                        deliver a completely new experience to the user</strong> : This innovation often
                                    create USP/key
                                    differentiator for the product compared to the competition in the respective
                                    segment. And if the feature is killer, it changes the user’s behavior which in turn
                                    changes user expectation. And then the competition has no other option but to play
                                    the catch-up game. This creates a very strong moat. For example, YouTube uses AI to
                                    generate subtitles in multiple languages on the fly. They have fundamentally changed
                                    user expectations and other platforms have to have a similar feature.
                                    <p>This kind of innovation is often not as easy as it may sound. I have written
                                        about this in an earlier post (ref : <a
                                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6830708981107867648-JQz_/">Hobbiton
                                            - Uses cases where AI can deliver great returns</a>). This requires first
                                        principle thinking. Product managers who can envision features in a completely
                                        new way using AI, very close collaboration between AI &amp; product teams to
                                        understand what is possible what is not, a very good execution to deliver
                                        A-class experience (despite AI model will make mistakes).</p>

                                    <strong>Building the dataset for the problem at hand</strong> : For AI teams
                                    embedded in product settings, building a comprehensive dataset for the problem
                                    at hand is often 80% of the battle. Building such a dataset is never writing a
                                    bunch of queries on a massive data store at your disposal. AI Teams often have
                                    to come up with very smart strategies, hacks to augment data to arrive at a
                                    comprehensive dataset. Also, this is not a one-time activity but often highly
                                    iterative. What more type of data is needed - comes from the kind of mistakes
                                    your models are making.
                                    <p>I will soon be writing a dedicated post on some of the best examples I have
                                        seen/heard on innovative ideas to collect data.</p>

                                    <strong>Publishing paper/patent (doesn’t happen that often)</strong> : AI
                                    teams embedded in product teams do write patents and papers - but this is seldom
                                    their true north star.</p>
                                </li>

                            <p>So what about coming up with newer techniques? Rarely AI teams embedded in product teams
                                do this. Why? Because in most cases, known techniques with a comprehensive dataset with
                                rigorous evaluation itself can take your AI solution very very far on business metrics.
                                From there on it is mostly a game of diminishing returns. Read about “later part of S

                                only if AI is the backbone of your product and your core value proposition.</p>

                        <p>A lot of companies and teams are betting big on DeepTech like AI to drive the next phase of
                            growth. While AI can certainly be the “energy” to help you move to the next orbit, most
                            teams falter big time. While there are many reasons for this, one key reason is the
                            ill-founded expectations by senior people (VPs, CXOs, business leaders etc) in the company.
                            Today’s post will explore this facet of AI - often the least spoken one.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>Most leaders/companies start AI in their teams/product lines much later. Traditional
                            corporate wisdom has always advocated “quick” wins because that is how one establishes
                            themselves and gets the key stakeholders super excited. So they advocate the same in AI!</p>

                        <p>This is also driven by:</p>

                                <li>Articles on AI in popular media with lofty claims (remember the humanoid dancing in
                                    Tesla AI day or Sophia - not many people understand these are mere marketing and
                                    perception gimmicks)</li>
                                <li>The thought that AI at the end of the day is a code - so it cannot be very different
                                    from software engineering. The issues are mere initial hiccups which is always the
                                    case with any new tech, so is the case with AI</li>

                            <p>So most leaders expect the ROI curve in AI to be a vertical takeoff. This expectation is
                                further fueled by the fact that AI doesn’t come cheap - data, data engg &amp; AI teams,
                                talent cost, hardware cost, data collection &amp; labeling cost and time etc, MLOps etc

                            <p>This is where most Orgs/Teams make THE mistake. The true ROI curve in AI is very very
                                different from their expectations. As shown in the figure below, it follows a S shape

                                    because most of the hard work has been done in the first 1-3 years. All key
                                    stakeholders have a better understanding of the AI journey. This phase is all about

                                </li>

                                    Later upper part of S: This is where the ROI again starts to stagnate. This phase is
                                    where your team is building the 6th/7th version of the system and trying to push
                                    systems performance to the upper 90s. This often requires completely new approaches,
                                    new algorithms. Its not just adding a couple of lines of code!

                        <p>I am often asked why is AI is a hard technology? (both in terms of time and money). There are
                            multiple reasons for it:</p>
                        <div class="archive__item-excerpt">

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Finding the right use case: finding a problem that is important to its users and
                                        can be solved well by AI. I talked earlier on this <a
                                            href="https://lnkd.in/eiAYU9eq">here</a></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Having the right data: most companies have tonnes of data but seldom have the data
                                    for the problem at hand. In AI its not just the quantity of data that matters but
                                    also the quality of data. Do you have the training data that resembles the
                                    production data very closely? Does it have enough data points that represent various
                                    outliers, mean data points, data points near the actual decision boundary etc</li>
                                <li>
                                    Labeling cost - If you need to get your data manually labeled, this will need lots
                                    of time and money. The process of labeling itself might not be straightforward. How
                                    do you benchmark the quality of labeling? If your labelers are making mistakes this
                                    can jeopardize the entire project.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Compute cost - the cost of the compute needed for training the model and for
                                    inference. This is especially crucial if your solution uses deep learning.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Going from a solution to the solution: In AI there is no one way to solve a problem.
                                    There are multiple ways and each will give you a different accuracy. Getting from
                                    the point where you have a model that gives you an acceptable performance to getting
                                    to a model that gives you fabulous performance is often a very long journey.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Fitting model into the product to get AI-driven feature: Its not just a simple API
                                    integration. One needs to figure out the best UX to serve the predictions, should
                                    this UX be intrusive or soft suggestions, UX should be able to gracefully handle the
                                    scenarios when the model makes mistakes, a mechanism to let the human take over when
                                    it is going all wrong for the end-user, instrumentation to collect data to
                                    continuously evaluate the performance of the model on prod data, instrumentation to
                                    collect data for future modeling efforts.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Need to retrain model: many times AI systems require one to retrain the model after
                                    every 15-30 days on the latest data.


                                </li>

                                    Talent: DS/ML team alone cannot pull off all the above. You need good and diverse
                                    talent for this - ML/DS folks who can evaluate the various approaches depending on
                                    the situation and can take the most suitable one to build the right model (and not
                                    blindly apply DL), Data engineers to build data pipelines to collect all data, a
                                    product manager who can figure out right use case, build instrumentation, UX to
                                    handle mistakes, a AI leader who understands this entire life cycle and work very
                                    closely with business and speak their language. This talent doesn’t come cheap.

                        <p>The last decade has seen a crazy amount of advances in the field of AI. Equally astonishing
                            is the speed with which these advances have made their way into industrial applications.
                            Despite this there aren’t a lot of successful AI systems around us.</p>
                        <p>
                            The performance of a AI system stems from 2 key components:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Algorithmic technique used to build the model.</li>
                            <li>
                                Dataset used to train the model. You change any one of them, the performance of the AI
                                system will change.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <div class="archive__item-excerpt">
                            <p>Academicians (owing to their bias & quest for fundamental advances) keep the dataset
                                constant and vary the algorithm. This allows them to compare 2 AI algorithms and
                                establish which one is better seamlessly. Further, in academia, the test set is usually
                                a chunk of the dataset itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                This approach doesn’t work well in the industry. The industry works on the idea of
                                Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The idea is never to build ‘THE model’ especially in the
                                early days of an AI system. The idea is to build ‘a model’ that is good enough for
                                various stakeholders to realize the value and deliver/estimate this value in the fastest
                                possible manner. Further, the model should be able to do well on the production data and
                                not on some benchmark dataset.</p>
                            <p>
                                Also, note that the value is delivered by a system and not just the model. Model is just
                                a small part of it. One needs to answer the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Does the AI system solve an important problem? a problem users deeply care about
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Does the value proposition of AI system fit well within the larger Value proposition
                                    of the product?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Does the AI system model and solve the problem (fairly) well? # of mistakes it
                                    makes? Is the cost of mistakes ok with your users or its catastrophic?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Does one have the right type, quantity and quality of data to solve the problem at
                                    hand? If not, invest heavily in data collection and data plumbing first.
                                </li>
                                <li>Does the UI/UX deliver the predictions seamlessly and does it handle the mistakes
                                    gracefully? Does it allow the user to override a model especially when predictions
                                    are going wrong?</li>
                                <li>How well the system does on production data (which is often very different from
                                    training data) - drift in data, drift in labels, handle outliers etc</li>
                                <li>
                                    What is the cost of running an AI system? Cost of getting the data labeled
                                    continuously to benchmark systems performance?
                                </li>
                                <li>Does the (medium-long term) returns from the AI system » overall investment in
                                    building and maintaining the AI system? [In short-medium most AI efforts are cost
                                    negative]
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            The success of AI system depends on all the above. It is this that makes building AI systems

                        <p>One often comes across organizations trying to apply AI to problems when it is really not
                            needed. Such organizations often end up doing so because either someone in the org wants to
                            look cool or a CXO in the company wants to start doing AI (mostly out of FOMO or
                            ill-informed media articles with lofty claims). AI is just a tool to solve problems (though
                            a powerful one), just like other problem-solving tools such as engineering, or operations.
                            Today AI can solve some problems quickly & very well which was not possible until even a
                            decade ago. But that doesn’t mean AI is a sledgehammer for every difficult problem. Despite
                            crazy advances in the last decade, AI is a very nascent, fragile and expensive technology
                            and must be applied after due thought and not as a go-to approach for every problem in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>
                            One of my favorite examples of this is Google’s approach to “searching for special
                            characters in Google Docs”. Here is the problem statement: Most users who create docs or
                            decks once in a while use special characters. But it is very hard to find the right special
                            character when you need it. Given the large number of special characters that exist, one
                            cannot show all of them to the user. To facilitate quick accessibility, one requires the
                            ability to search for them. However, there is one particular problem with special characters
                            - most users cannot remember them by name (try recalling names of 10 or more special
                            characters yourself). This renders “textual search” useless. So, how does one solve this?
                            Visual search!

                            <p>Google used a very simple but powerful observation - most users can very easily recall
                                how the special character that they need looks like, unlike their name. So, they
                                provided a small sketch pad for users to draw what they remember and use the concepts
                                from computer vision (Sketch-RNN) to suggest a few closest options based on the visual
                                match. The same concept was later used to power Auto draw.

                                I often use this example to drive home the point that one often needs to think from
                                first principles when thinking of AI-powered use cases. For the above-mentioned example,
                                the more you think the more you will realize:</p>
                            <p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The problem could not have been solved by traditional engineering approaches.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It is a very well-defined narrow problem statement.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The core AI concept (Sketch-RNN) was just right to solve this problem statement
                                    well.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The solution (powered by AI in this case) really helped to solve the user’s pain
                                    point and deliver happiness.
                                </li>

                            </ul>
                            </p>
