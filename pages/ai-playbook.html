          Welcome to the AI Playbook, your comprehensive go-to guide to successfully navigating the AI landscape. Whether you are a Founder, VC, CXO, or part of a startup or multinational corporation, this book offers practical insights and proven strategies to effectively leverage AI.
          The book focuses on what it takes to create business wins (revenue or market dominance) from your AI efforts.

          <!-- AI is no more an option for many organizations out there. While a lot of organizations are investing heavily, very few (likes Google, MS, OpenAI, Tesla, byteDance, Cohere, Perplexity) are seeing any ROI - revenue & market dominance. 
          This raises a question: what is that these few AI first companies are doing right that the other newbies are missing? What is that the newbies are doing wrong as comoared to the AI first companies that is preventing them getting to business outcomes from their AI efforts?

        <b>AI is No Longer Optional for Organizations</b>
        <br>

          While many companies are investing heavily in AI, only a few—likes of Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Tesla, ByteDance, Cohere, and Perplexity—are seeing significant returns on investment, such as revenue growth and market dominance.

        This begs the question: <i>What are these AI-first leaders doing right that other companies are missing? What mistakes are the newcomers making compared to these pioneers, preventing them from achieving tangible business outcomes from their AI efforts?</i>

        If we were to distill the answer into one image, it would be this:

          <img
              src="/images/the_mistake.jpg"

            <br>

            <!-- A lot of teams/orgs believe building AI systems is all about getting to a good AI model. Truth cannot be far from this. A key aspect to getting AI efforts right is "AI Maturity" or "AI Readiness" in the Org. 
          Simply speaking "AI Maturity" is key knowledge that AI ≠ IT/Software Engineering and that the playbooks, best practices of IT/SE development fail in the AI realm. It is about understanding 
          that building AI systems that create business wins requires one to get a lot of small but crucial components right across the Organization. 
          Further, AI is not IT initiative which is the sole responsibility of CTO/CIO. But it is an Org wide initiative and this key knowledge must be well known to a large fraction of Org, specially all the key stakeholders.
          This is akin to developing and driving Formula 1 racing cars. Someone coming from consumer automobile world might think that the process of developing & running Formula 1 racing cars is similar to that of consumar cars. Truth cannot be far from it. 
          Anyone who has developed and ran Formula 1 racing cars, will tell you the whole process is so very different and requries entire Org to know this very well.

 <b>Misconceptions About Building AI Systems</b>
<br>
 Many teams and organizations mistakenly believe that building successful AI systems is all about developing a good AI model. This couldn't be further from the truth. A critical factor in getting AI efforts right is understanding "AI Maturity" or "AI Readiness" within the organization.
 <br>
 AI Maturity is the realization that AI is fundamentally different from IT or software engineering. The playbooks and best practices that work for IT or software development fail miserably in the AI realm. Building AI systems that drive business success requires getting numerous small but crucial components right across the organization.
 
 AI initiatives are not just IT projects overseen by the CTO or CIO; they are organization-wide endeavors. This critical knowledge must be well understood by a broad segment of the organization, especially all key stakeholders & senior executives including Board Members.
 
 Think of it like developing and driving Formula 1 racing cars. Someone from the consumer automobile industry might assume the processes are similar, but in reality, they're worlds apart. Anyone experienced in Formula 1 will tell you that it demands a fundamentally different approach and that the entire organization must be aligned and knowledgeable about these unique requirements.
