          In recent years, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
          witnessed remarkable progress, with many breakthroughs now accessible
          through APIs and open-source solutions. Thanks to increased
          accessibility and ease of implementation, it has led organizations,
          ranging from fledgling startups to Fortune 100 MNCs, to actively
          integrate AI into their products and services.

          encounter data issues during the training phase, preventing them from
          progressing further. Another survey reveals that despite substantial
          investments, 8 out of 10 companies reported minimal or no return on
          investment (ROI) from their AI efforts.

    <p>
      Engineers started writing software in the 1970s. Over the past five
      decades, humans have deeply understood and mastered every aspect of
      software development right from requirements gathering to development, all
      the way to on-premise deployment and maintenance. Given mankind’s mastery
      of software development process, the ROI curve for standard software
      projects/systems is illustrated in Figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Fig 1, X-axis represents time, Y-axis represents ‘capability
      of’/’returns from’ the software system developed. The shape of the ROI
      curve is pretty intuitive to understand.
    </p>
    <p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, starting a typical IT/software development project demands time
      and effort—gathering requirements, scoping, budgeting, and assembling the
      right team. During this inception phase, the capability/returns show slow
      growth, resulting in the ROI curve with a flat slope. But once we are past
      this initial stage, the ROI curve of the software system rises steeply.
      Within a few days/weeks of starting the development, one starts to see the
      gains materialize pretty quickly, creating a steep rise in the curve.
      Powerful and efficient development tools, frameworks, programming
      languages, agile methodology, tools, extensive software development
      experience, cloud computing, collaborative development platforms coupled
      with automation and DevOps have contributed significantly to the hockey
      stick shape of this curve.

    <p>
      When it comes to the ROI curve of a typical AI project/system, its shape
      is very different. Without further ado, this is what the ROI curve in AI
      looks like:
    </p>

      <p style="color: #4c77b0">
        Immediately one sees distinct similarities and notable differences
        between this curve and previous one. In contrast to Fig 1, the initial
        segment of the curve remains remarkably flat for an extended duration,
        resulting in a more elongated form. Subsequently, it ascends fast,
        albeit not as sharply as in Fig 1. Most intriguingly, towards the
        conclusion, the curve stagnates sharply.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #4c77b0">
        This shape of ROI curve for AI surprises many industry practitioners,
        especially those with extensive software engineering background.
        Founders, CXOs, leaders, and managers often anticipate an AI system's
        ROI curve to mirror that of software systems, resembling a hockey stick.
        However, this is far from reality.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #4c77b0">
        Reason? The long-standing, well-understood playbooks of software
        development do not work for AI development. This greatly impacts the ROI
        curve for AI. Let us try to understand this better and uncover why the
        shape of the curve changes. To do so, we divide the curve into three
        main segments: O-A, A-B, and B-M and then look at each segment in detail
        as under. The attempt is to better understand AI development and write
        its playbook.

            approaches, do we have the kind of data that is needed to solve the
            problem well. Most importantly: is our overall
            solution/product/service a pain killer or a vitamin for the market

        <p>
          Why do we say so? Because AI is an expensive technology - massive
          datasets, hardware for compute, AI talent; none of it comes cheap.
          There is no point in building a state-of-the-art model for a problem
          where each prediction costs you $3 but the market is not willing to
          pay you more than $1 per prediction (or worst - market shows no
          interest in your solution). There is no way you can build a viable
          business from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, building a great model is hard and takes time. You need a very
          good understanding of the problem, great team in terms of skillset,
          even greater datasets and heavy compute (in case of deep learning).
          You should not invest time & resources of this level, unless one is
          very sure of being able to build a viable business from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any seasoned entrepreneur will tell you - building a business from
          scratch is by far the hardest thing. There are just too many variables
          that determine its success . So why get obsessed with state-of-the-art
          model upfront?

          The objective of this phase must be to aack the hardest part of the
          problem - it is not building the best model (unless you are a pure
          research lab). The hardest part is to answer questions on business
          direction:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>

              killer vs vitamin)

          <li>
            <p>
              Does the AI system seem to meet its business objectives? Ex: Alexa
              was a great AI product bt failed to meet its business goals i.e.
              power more orders from Amazon.co
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would users/clients be willing to pay for it ? If yes, then how

          <li>
            <p>
              Do you think you can extract enough LTV to offset the high dev

          This is a fundamental difference when doing AI in product companies vs

          In mature organizations, data is systematically organized for quick
          access by internal consumers like AI teams. This is akin to a
          well-organized pantry in a professional kitchen, enabling chefs to
          create dishes swiftly. Conversely, in organizations lacking data
          strategy, data is stored haphazardly, akin to dumping ingredients into
          cold storage. Retrieving specific data becomes a time-consuming
          project in its on, greatly hindering AI projects, a common oversight
          among founders and executives.

        <p style="color: #4c77b0">

            >In most organisations, that do not have data maturity, most AI
            projects die in the O-A phase itself! </b

          Many teams, founders, and executives often overlook the vital step of
          establishing appropriate success metrics and measurement methods,
          fixating solely on the model. It's crucial to systematically define AI
          and business metrics, ensuring their correlation. Getting this right
          from day one is akin to building a rocketship without a control panel,
          especially in AI, where systems are stochastic and prone to errors,
          impacting accuracy and effectiveness quantification.

          You may wonder, we never talked about the model or underlying
          algorithm. Use any model/algorithm that gets the job done - 3rd part
          API, open source or even humans producing predictions in real time! As
          we argued earlier, it is wrong to invest in building a great model in

          If you are not training your own v0 model, you can downplay the
          dataset creation & labelling steps. But do keep in mind that once your
          project goes beyond point A, you will need good dataset to train
          models - it is always best to start this early to better understand
          the risk to the project.

        Imagine it's 1920, the World War I has just concluded. For the first
        time in history, air bombers took to skies and influenced the outcome of
        any war. You are Richard Branson, a young, energetic, and budding
        entrepreneur looking for your next big bold idea in your quest to create
        the next unicorn. Given your sharp acumen, you quickly realize that one
        can modify air bombers to transport goods & people from one part of the
        world to another and charge the end customer for the same. You could be
        the first one in the world to usher in the era of commercial aviation.

        If your answer is going to be (a), then why should it be any different
        while developing AI systems? Why this obsession with state-of-the-art
        LLMs from Day 1! Just as an airplane has over thousands of parts so does
        an AI system. One needs to get the whole AI system right to create the
        business wins. Getting to THE AI system is a journey. State of the art

      <p>
        Let us now understand how LLMs (chatGPT, Claude, Cohere etc) or any off
        the shelf foundational models has impacted this curve. Now owing to
        commoditization of chatGPT/ LLMs, (via APIs), one gets high degree of
        “intelligence” off the shelf (but not 100% - even these systems make a
        lot of mistakes) without any training what so ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means, using any of these off the shelf solutions, today a smart
        Product Manager (PM) with an hungry Business Leader (BL) can assemble a
        v0 solution without necessarily involving an AI team. They along with a
        street smart aspiring engineer can do enough prompt engineering to
        quickly assemble together an AI system within 7-10 days which good
        enough to demo in the market. Recall, this was the very objective of O-A
        phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can now use the demo sell their ‘solution’ aggressively and test
        the market - are your users loving the solution? Are they willing to pay
        for it? How much are they willing to pay etc which is one of the most
        impotent parts of the first phase O-A.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <img src="/images//ROI//fig7.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us understand the above in terms of the curve. Using chatGPT/off the
      shelf LLMs via API - one can get fairly high intelligence. This is
      represented by point ‘X’ in Figure 7. And since one can get to it very
      quickly, we have a straight line from pt ‘O’ to pt ‘X’. In most cases,
      this much intelligence is good enough to start selling your
      product/offerings in the market
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point in time, as your paying customers go up, they will be more
      demanding in term of model accuracy. Now chatGPTs of the world are generic
      systems trained on generic data, hence no matter how much prompt
      engineering you do, they will take you only so far. To improve your
      systems further, your next logical choice will be to fine tune open source
      foundational models on your data. This will require you to gather data,
      build your own datasets. What after that? trained your own foundational
      models from scratch. Note this exactly the journey we saw from O-A-B-M in
      Fig 4. only difference now will be the accuracies/ML metric values will be
      much higher, hence the curve now takes the same shape beyond ‘X’.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to call out that today AI is niche technology and is a
      rapidly evolving landscape. In times to come, owing to commoditization,
      both cost and time to develop AI systems will come down drastically. Then
      the curve could look very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ROI curve discussed describes whats is the right way to develop AI
      systems today. This is unlikely to change in next 12-18 months. After
      that? who knows. We will keeping replenishing this writeup as the AI
      landscape changes.
    </p>
    <p>Adios until then.</p>
