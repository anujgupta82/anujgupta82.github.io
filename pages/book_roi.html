        In recent years, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
        witnessed remarkable progress, with many breakthroughs now accessible
        through APIs and open-source solutions. Thanks to this increased
        accessibility and ease of implementation, it has led organizations,
        ranging from fledgling startups to Fortune 100 MNCs, to actively
        integrate AI into their products and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, amidst this surge in adoption, significant challenges remain.
        <b>One major hurdle is the high failure rate of AI projects in the
          industry</b>. According to a recent survey [1], a staggering 96% of AI projects
        encounter data issues during the training phase, preventing them from
        progressing further. Another survey [2] reveals that despite substantial
        investments, 8 out of 10 companies reported minimal or no return on
        investment (ROI) from their AI efforts.
        <b>These findings underscore the need for addressing critical issues
          in AI implementation to ensure successful outcomes and maximize the
          potential benefits of this rapidly evolving technology.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article, we present the
        <b>“AI Capability Continuum”, a three-step framework tailored to help
          you conceptualize the development and assess the capabilities of AI
          systems</b>. To elucidate this framework effectively, we will utilize the capability curve.

    Consider the following: as one implements more n more parts of a software system, its
    capabilities (things it is able to do) keep on increasing. If one were to draw a 2D curve with Yaxis as capability
    and X-axis as time, and draw growth in software’s capability with time, How
    would that curve look like?
  </p>
  <div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="flex: 50%;">
      <p>
        Engineers started writing software in the 1970s. Over the past five
        decades, humans have deeply understood and mastered every aspect of
        software development right from requirements gathering to development, all
        the way to on-premise deployment and maintenance. Given mankind’s mastery
        of software development process,<b> the capability curve for standard software
          projects/systems is illustrated in Figure 1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us now understand the why the shape of this
        curve is the way it is :
      </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Initially, starting a typical IT/software development project demands time and effort—gathering
    requirements, scoping, budgeting, and assembling the right team. During this inception phase, the
    capability grows slowly, resulting in the capability curve with a flat slope. But once we are past this
    initial stage, the capability
    curve of the software system rises steeply. Within a few days/weeks of
    starting the development, one starts to see the gains
    materialize pretty quickly, creating a steep
    rise in the curve. Powerful and efficient development tools, frameworks, programming languages,
    agile methodology, tools, extensive software development experience, cloud computing,
    collaborative development platforms coupled with automation and DevOps have contributed
    significantly to the hockey stick shape of this curve.

  <p>
    When it comes to the capability curve of a typical AI project/system, any guesses what the shape
    might look like? it is very different:

      ">
    <p style="color: #4c77b0">
      Immediately one sees distinct similarities and notable differences between this curve
      and previous one. In contrast to Fig 1 (on previous page), the initial segment of the
      curve in Fig 2 remains remarkably flat for an extended duration, resulting in a more
      elongated form. Subsequently, it ascends fast, albeit not as sharply as in Fig 1. Most
      intriguingly, towards the conclusion, the curve stagnates sharply.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #4c77b0">
      This shape of capability curve for AI surprises many industry practitioners, especially
      those with extensive software engineering background. Founders, CXOs, leaders, and
      managers often anticipate an AI system's capability curve to mirror that of software
      systems, (resembling a hockey stick). However, this is far from reality.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #4c77b0">
      Reason? The long-standing, well-understood playbooks of software development do not
      work for AI development. This greatly impacts the capability curve for AI. Let us try to
      understand this better and uncover why the shape of the curve changes. To
      do so, we
      divide the curve into three main segments: Foundation Zone (O-A), Acceleration Ramp
      (A-B), and Maturity Plateau (B-M) and then look at
      each segment in detail as under. The
      attempt is to better understand AI development and write its playbook.

    Depending on the difficulty of the problem at hand, the AI maturity/literacy

          Models (LLMs) is unacceptable. This should never be the aim of this
          phase.</em></b>
      </p>
      <p style="color: #4c77b0">
        <b>The purpose of Foundation phase is to understand the fundamental aspects
          of the problem - are we solving the right problem, is the problem at
          hand is even an AI problem or can be solved using traditional
          approaches, do we have the kind of data that is needed to solve the
          problem well. <u>Most importantly:</u> is our overall
          solution/product/service a pain killer or a vitamin for the market
          and what kind of price market is willing to pay for it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do we say so? Because AI is an expensive technology - massive
        datasets, hardware for compute, AI talent; none of it comes cheap.
        There is no point in building a state-of-the-art model for a problem
        where each prediction costs you $3 but the market is not willing to
        pay you more than $1 per prediction (or worst - market shows no
        interest in your solution). There is no way you can build a viable
        business from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, building a great model is hard and takes time. You need a very
        good understanding of the problem, great team in terms of skillset,
        even greater datasets and heavy compute (in case of deep learning).
        You should not invest time & resources of this level, unless one is
        very sure of being able to build a viable business from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any seasoned entrepreneur knows that building a business from
        scratch is extremely challenging  (which is why successful ones are called unicorns). Numerous variables affect
        success. So, why obsess over having a state-of-the-art model from the start?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The objective of this phase must be to attack the hardest part of the
        problem - it is not building the best model (unless you are a pure
        research lab). The hardest part is to answer questions on business
        direction:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>
          <p>
            Are we building something that solves a major pain point (pain
            killer vs vitamin)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does the AI system seem to meet its business objectives? Ex: Alexa
            was a great AI product but failed to meet its business goals i.e.
            power more orders from Amazon.com
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Would users/clients be willing to pay for it ? If yes, then how
            much?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do you think you can extract enough LTV to offset the high dev
            cost, indirect costs and margins to build a long term profitable
            business?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a fundamental difference when doing AI in product companies vs
        academia/ research labs. Academia/Research Labs are focused on
        advancing state-of-the-art. To drive home the point check 'thought

        In mature organizations, data is systematically organized for quick
        access by internal consumers like AI teams. This is akin to a
        well-organized pantry in a professional kitchen, enabling chefs to
        create dishes swiftly. Conversely, in organizations lacking data
        strategy, data is stored haphazardly, akin to dumping ingredients into
        cold storage. Retrieving specific data becomes a time-consuming
        project in its on, greatly hindering AI projects, a common oversight
        among founders and executives.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #4c77b0">
        <b>In most organisations, that do not have data maturity, most AI
          projects die in the O-A phase itself! </b><em>Thus, if you are serious about
        AI, getting your data strategy right is very important.</em>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Many teams, founders, and executives often overlook the vital step of
        establishing appropriate success metrics and measurement methods,
        fixating solely on the model. It's crucial to systematically define AI
        and business metrics, ensuring their correlation. Getting this right
        from day one is akin to building a rocketship without a control panel,
        especially in AI, where systems are stochastic and prone to errors,
        impacting accuracy and effectiveness quantification.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You may wonder, we never talked about the model or underlying
        algorithm. Use any model/algorithm that gets the job done - 3rd party
        API, open source or even humans producing predictions in real time! As
        we argued earlier, it is wrong to invest in building a great model in
        this phase. Aim should be to quickly assemble a system and test the
        markets right-away.

        If you are not training your own v0 model, you can downplay the
        dataset creation & labelling steps. But do keep in mind that once your
        project goes beyond point A, you will need good dataset to train
        models - it is always best to start this early to better understand
        the risk to the project.

    <b>This phase also explains why the age old corporate wisdom of getting

  <h2 style="color: #0c3a81">Impact of chatGPT/LLMs</h2>
  <div style="

    <p>
      Let us now understand how LLMs (chatGPT, Claude, Cohere etc) or any off
      the shelf foundational models has impacted this curve. Now owing to
      commoditization of chatGPT/ LLMs, (via APIs), one gets high degree of
      “intelligence” off the shelf (but not 100% - even these systems make a
      lot of mistakes) without any training what so ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means, using any of these off the shelf solutions, today a smart
      Product Manager (PM) with an hungry Business Leader (BL) can assemble a
      v0 solution without necessarily involving an AI team. They along with a
      street smart aspiring engineer can do enough prompt engineering to
      quickly assemble together an AI system within 7-10 days which good
      enough to demo in the market. Recall, this was the very objective of O-A
      phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      They can now use the demo sell their ‘solution’ aggressively and test
      the market - are your users loving the solution? Are they willing to pay
      for it? How much are they willing to pay etc which is one of the most
      impotent parts of the first phase O-A.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    <img src="../images/ROI/fig7.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us understand the above in terms of the curve. Using chatGPT/off the
    shelf LLMs via API - one can get fairly high intelligence. This is
    represented by point ‘X’ in Figure 7. And since one can get to it very
    quickly, we have a straight line from pt ‘O’ to pt ‘X’. In most cases,
    this much intelligence is good enough to start selling your
    product/offerings in the market
  </p>
  <p>
    At some point in time, as your paying customers go up, they will be more
    demanding in term of model accuracy. Now chatGPTs of the world are generic
    systems trained on generic data, hence no matter how much prompt
    engineering you do, they will take you only so far. To improve your
    systems further, your next logical choice will be to fine tune open source
    foundational models on your data. This will require you to gather data,
    build your own datasets. What after that? trained your own foundational
    models from scratch. Note this exactly the journey we saw from O-A-B-M in
    Fig 4. only difference now will be the accuracies/ML metric values will be
    much higher, hence the curve now takes the same shape beyond ‘X’.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to call out that today AI is niche technology and is a
    rapidly evolving landscape. In times to come, owing to commoditization,
    both cost and time to develop AI systems will come down drastically. Then
    the curve could look very different.
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out that using this curve one answer some very crucial questions - what is the right process to develop AI
    systems,  from a talent acquisition purpose when is the right time to
bring in AI scientist with PhD pedigree, why profit margin of AI companies will never be
more than 40% unlike SaaS companies that have 80-85% margins and many more.

  <p>We will answer these and many more in next set of articles. Adios until then.
