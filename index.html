              Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anujgupta-82/">Anuj Gupta</a>, 
              a seasoned AI executive with over 20 years in core AI, 
              leading end-to-end AI initiatives at the CXO level. I've spearheaded AI 
              efforts and built AI systems in startups (0-1, 1-n) as well as Fortune 50 companies, 
              some of these led to acquisitions and IPOs. I have led multiple teams & efforts that developed commercially 
              successful AI products and features contributing significantly to revenue & Org KPIs. 
              I’ve led AI teams of 5-80 people spanning multiple geographies, managing the entire 
              team & lifecycle of AI projects. I’ve worked very closely with Founders and my C-suite peers across Business, 
              Product, Engineering, Sales, and HR to drive KPIs at organizational level. Notably, I led AI efforts 
              at (possibaly) India’s first startup funded for its AI-first approach (back in 2013)!

              has led and built commercially successful AI products/features
              directly contributing to revenue. He has set up and owned AI
              function end-to-end, right from vision, strategy, roadmap,
              incubating & grooming high-performance AI teams, execution;
              delivering KPIs at CXO level. He has led AI teams of size 5-50

                    <p>
                        I have also created <a
                            href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator">a
                            set of Jupyter notebooks</a>
                        that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual
                        markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs
                        in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My
                        usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in
                        these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub
                        repository.

                    <p>
                        Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to
                        GitHub’s servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration
                        and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like <a
                            href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md">this
                            one</a>
                        and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the “Raw |
                        Blame | History” buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of
                        the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and
                        clicking the “Create new file” or “Upload files” buttons.
